The analysis of bootstrap samples from the population data reveals that the sample means and standard deviations closely approximate the population mean and standard deviation, respectively. This suggests that the bootstrap method effectively estimates these Blood Pressure statistics. However, there is slightly more variability observed in the 75th percentile of Blood Pressure among the sample percentiles compared to the mean and standard deviation. Despite this, the bootstrap sampling method provides reliable estimates for Blood Pressure statistics, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the characteristics of the population data.}
